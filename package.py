'''
Choose a name for your package. 
It's recommended to use all lowercase letters
 and underscores for spaces. For example, 
 if you want to create a package for handling 
 dates, you could name it "date_utils".

Create a new directory with the name of your
 package. In this example, you would create
   a directory called "date_utils".

Inside the directory, create a file 
called __init__.py. This file can be empty or
 contain some code that should be executed
 when the package is imported.

Create the modules for your package. 
These are the Python files that contain the 
actual code for your package. For example,
 you could create a module called 
 "date_parser.py" that contains a 
 function for parsing dates.

Optionally, you can include a setup.py 
file in the root of your package directory. 
This file contains information about your 
package, such as its name, version, author, 
and dependencies.

Optionally, you can also include a README.md 
file in the root of your package directory. 
This file should contain information about 
your package, such as its purpose, usage, 
and installation instructions.
Here's an example directory structure for 
the "date_utils" package:
'''

#date_utils/
#    __init__.py
#    date_parser.py
#    setup.py
#    README.md


'''
Once you've created your package, 
you can use it in other Python code by 
importing it like any other module. 
For example, to use the parse_date function 
from the date_parser module in the date_utils 
package, you would write:
'''
#from date_utils.date_parser import parse_date
